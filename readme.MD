GraphQL:

what is it?
is an open source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.
It is an alternative to the REST API, with some added benefits such as the ability torequest the exact data that you want.

On simple terms it looks like a hybrid between the REST API and the SQL.
GraphQL servers have a schema that specifies all of the fields as well as thir types.
